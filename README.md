# Project Name: Sentiment Analysis with MrJob and Hadoop

## Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on text data using MrJob, a Python library for MapReduce programming, and a single-node Hadoop cluster. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, neutral, or negative.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- MrJob
- Hadoop (single-node cluster)
- Text data for sentiment analysis

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.x: [Python Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install MrJob using pip:
   ```
   pip install mrjob
   ```
3. Set up a single-node Hadoop cluster. You can use Hadoop in standalone mode for simplicity:
   - Download Hadoop: [Apache Hadoop Downloads](https://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html)
   - Follow the installation instructions provided with Hadoop.
   - Configure Hadoop in standalone mode.
   
## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Sentiment-analysis-using-MRJOB.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd sentiment-analysis-mrjob-hadoop
   ```
3. Prepare your text data for sentiment analysis. Ensure the data is in a suitable format, such as plain text or CSV.
4. Modify the provided MrJob script (`sentiment_analysis_mrjob.py`) according to your data and analysis requirements.
5. Run the MrJob script with Hadoop:
   ```
   python test_sentiment.py -r hadoop <input_file> --output-dir <output_directory>
   ```
   Replace `<input_file>` with the path to your input data file and `<output_directory>` with the desired output directory.
6. Monitor the job progress and view the output generated by Hadoop.

## How it Works
1. **MapReduce Paradigm**: MrJob simplifies the implementation of MapReduce programs in Python by abstracting away the complexities of the MapReduce paradigm. The sentiment analysis logic is encapsulated within the Mapper and Reducer functions.
   
2. **Hadoop Single-node Cluster**: Hadoop provides a distributed computing framework for processing large datasets across clusters of computers. In this project, a single-node Hadoop cluster is utilized to leverage the parallel processing capabilities of Hadoop.

3. **YARN Resource Management**: YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is responsible for resource management in Hadoop. It allocates resources to various applications and oversees their execution. Understanding YARN's resource allocation and task execution mechanisms provides insights into how Hadoop operates internally.
